# Task 03
Welcome to Task 03! This task involves solving the same set of problems in multiple programming languages. Hereâ€™s how each sub-task is implemented in different languages.

Approach
# Sub-Task 1: "Hello, World!"
Approach:

This is a basic exercise to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
It serves as a starting point to ensure the programming environment is correctly set up and to demonstrate basic syntax in each language.
Review:

Python: Direct use of print() function; straightforward and idiomatic.
Ruby: Uses puts, which is Ruby's preferred method for outputting text with a newline.
Elixir: Utilizes IO.puts, which is standard for printing in Elixir.
JavaScript: console.log() is commonly used for output in JavaScript environments.
Java: System.out.println() is the standard way to print to the console in Java.
Go: Uses fmt.Println() to print the string, which is idiomatic for Go.
C: printf is used, which is a part of the C standard library for formatted output.
C++: std::cout is the standard way to output text in C++.
Rust: println! macro is used for output, which is common in Rust.

# Sub-Task 2: File Copy
Approach:

Read content from input.txt.
Write the read content to output.txt.
This demonstrates file handling and basic I/O operations in each language.
Review:

Python: Uses context managers (with statement) for safe file operations, which is a best practice in Python.
Ruby: Utilizes File.read and File.write methods for straightforward file operations.
Elixir: Directly reads and writes files in a concise manner using File.read! and File.write!.
JavaScript: Uses fs.readFile and fs.writeFile for asynchronous file operations.
Java: Employs Files.readAllBytes and Files.write from the NIO package, which is a modern and efficient way to handle file I/O.
Go: Reads from and writes to files using ioutil package functions, which is simple and effective.
C: Uses fopen, fread, and fwrite for file operations, which is more manual compared to higher-level languages.
C++: Uses std::ifstream and std::ofstream for reading from and writing to files.
Rust: fs::read_to_string and fs::write provide an idiomatic way to handle file operations with error handling.
# Sub-Task 3: Diamond Pattern to Console
Approach:

Takes user input for the number n.
Generates a diamond pattern of asterisks with n rows in the top half and n-1 rows in the bottom half.
Prints the pattern to the console.
Review:

Python: Uses nested loops and string operations to generate the pattern. Simple and clear.
Ruby: Similar approach to Python, leveraging Ruby's string manipulation capabilities.
Elixir: Uses list comprehensions and IO.puts to generate and print the pattern in a functional style.
JavaScript: Uses string manipulation methods and loops to create and print the pattern.
Java: Utilizes String.repeat() and loops to handle the pattern generation. Standard approach for Java.
Go: Employs loops and string repetition to construct the pattern. Uses fmt for formatting output.
C: Manually handles string construction and output with nested loops and fputc.
C++: Uses std::string for pattern construction and std::cout for output.
Rust: Constructs the pattern using string repetition and concatenation, then writes to the console.
 # Sub-Task 4: Diamond Pattern to File
Approach:

Reads a number n from input.txt.
Generates a diamond pattern of asterisks.
Writes the pattern to output.txt.
Review:

Python: Uses similar logic to Sub-Task 3 but writes the pattern to a file. Uses file handling in a safe manner.
Ruby: Employs string concatenation and file writing in a concise way. Easy to read and maintain.
Elixir: Generates the pattern and writes it to a file using File.write. Functional and straightforward.
JavaScript: Asynchronously reads the input and writes the output using fs. Handles file operations effectively.
Java: Constructs the pattern and uses StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation before writing to the file.
Go: Similar approach to Python, using a strings.Builder for efficient string construction and writing to file.
C: Manually handles string output to the file, with explicit file operations and loop control.
C++: Uses std::ofstream and std::string to manage file writing and string manipulation efficiently.
Rust: Constructs the pattern in memory and writes it to a file. Handles file operations with error checking.
