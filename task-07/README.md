# Approach for the Pirate's Dilemma Task

Project Setup:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the provided GitHub repository.
Setup Environment: Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4, Click).

Main Functionality:

Input Handling: Create a CLI that accepts an .mp4 file as input.

Subtitle Search:
Extract the movie title from the file name.

Use an API like Open Subtitles or web scraping (with BeautifulSoup) to search for subtitles based on the movie title.

Display Options: Present the user with a list of available subtitles, showing details like language and title.

Download Subtitle: Allow the user to select a subtitle to download and save it as an .srt file in the same directory as the movie.

Implementation:

Use the Click library to handle the CLI input and output.
Implement functions to search for subtitles and download the selected one.
Handle errors, such as no subtitles found or download failures, gracefully.

Testing and Documentation:

Test the CLI with different movie files to ensure functionality.
Document the project with clear instructions on how to use the tool.
Review of the Task

Strengths:
The task is well-suited for practicing Python scripting, CLI development, and web scraping.
It provides an opportunity to interact with external APIs and handle user inputs in a command-line environment.

Challenges:
Handling various edge cases, such as movies with no available subtitles or multiple subtitle options.
Managing potential API limitations (e.g., rate limits) or errors in web scraping.

Improvements:
Consider adding more features, such as filtering subtitles by language or rating.
Enhance the user experience by providing more detailed feedback and error messages.
