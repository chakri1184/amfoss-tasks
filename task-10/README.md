# Approach for Operation Pixel Merge
The goal of this task is to create a script that stitches together fragmented images using OpenCV and Pillow to reveal a secret message. Below is an approach to achieve this:

1. Project Setup
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the provided GitHub repository.

bash
git clone https://github.com/hrideshmg/Operation-Pixel-Merge
cd Operation-Pixel-Merge

Setup Virtual Environment: Create and activate a virtual environment.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies: Install the required packages (opencv-python and Pillow).
bash
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy

3. Load and Preprocess Images
Load Images: Use OpenCV or Pillow to load the images from the specified directory.
Preprocess: If needed, preprocess the images to ensure they are of the same size and format.

5. Image Stitching
Feature Detection: Use OpenCV to detect key features and match them between images.
Homography Calculation: Compute the homography matrix to align and stitch the images together.
Stitching: Combine the images into a single image using the computed homography.

6. Explanation of the Code
load_images: Loads images from a specified folder. Assumes images are named sequentially.
stitch_images: Uses OpenCV's stitching functionality to combine images into a single panoramic image.
save_image: Converts the stitched image from OpenCV format to a PIL format and saves it.
main: Orchestrates loading, stitching, and saving of images.

7. Testing and Refinement
Test with Different Sets: Run the script with different sets of images to ensure it works under various conditions.
Handle Errors: Ensure robust error handling, especially for cases where stitching fails or images are missing.

8. Doumentation
README.md: Update the README with instructions on setting up the environment, running the script, and expected results.

# Review
Strengths:

Practical Application: Demonstrates skills in image processing and manipulation using OpenCV and Pillow.
Real-World Use: Useful for scenarios involving image stitching, such as creating panoramas or assembling large images from fragments.

Challenges:

Feature Detection and Matching: Accurate stitching depends on reliable feature detection and matching, which can be challenging with varying image conditions.
Image Alignment: Proper alignment of images to avoid visible seams or mismatches requires fine-tuning.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Image Quality: Ensure input images have good quality and overlap for better stitching results.
User Interface: Consider adding a graphical user interface or command-line options for selecting input folders and output paths.

This approach provides a foundation for stitching images and can be customized based on specific requirements or additional features.
